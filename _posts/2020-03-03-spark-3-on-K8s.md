Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) support for Spark on K8s is tracked at 
[SPARK-24432](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24432). 

Summary of its current status as of 11/01/2020:
- With external shuffle service: **not yet available** with spark-3. It is actively worked on 
(blocked by [SPARK-25299 Use remote storage for persisting shuffle data](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25299), blocked by [SPARK-26268 Decouple shuffle data from Spark deployment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26268) 
which is In-progress).

- Without external shuffle service: **avaiable** in spark-3 as experimental feature (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24817)

This post show how  you can try out running Spark3-K8s-DRA without external
 shuffle service, and show a simple performance and resource usage  comparison when running the same
 WordCount application in K8s vs. in Yarn

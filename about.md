## Dieu Tran.
 
Data Engineer @Wholesale Banking Advanced Analytics (WBAA), ING, Netherlands.

I create this blog  to  share my  thoughts and experiments, mostly  of what I learn as an
 engineer, but sometimes non-tech matters too.
 
## Interests

I'm interested in Big Data, Distributed Systems, Databases, Data Science. Work mostly with Spark
, briefly with Flink. I also like doing devops stuff, like deployment with Docker and K8s.

I watch chess online. My favorite player is GM.Magnus Carlsen. I subscribed the chess
 Youtube chanel `agadmator`.
 
I watch Silicon Valley,  The BigBang Theory, and  Friends. Multiple times. 

### Note: 
This blog is in incubation period. It will be updated soon. Stay tune!
